Hey Raj. Good work. 
See if you could consider the following criticisms/improvements i suggest, me being 15+ years more experieced than you. :)

Upon close inspection of the model, we can detect the presence of an undesirable smell lingering within the enviromment. 
The smell is accompanyied by a loud noise(>= 10 db) which is heard 2 to 3 times(pr prr prrrr). Our RL model labels this occurence as a fart, 
and upon playing with a few more parameters, we can speculate that it must be produced by some human, possibly un-intentionally. The human seems to be
of a royal origin, probably belonging to royal clans like King, Rajput, Maharana, or MAHARAJ. Here intuition helps us make the final choice and conclude,

    Maharaj farted ...................... English
    maharaj se tiró un pedo ............. Spanish
    marajá peidou........................ Portuguese
    MAHARAJ PAADA ........................ Hindi
